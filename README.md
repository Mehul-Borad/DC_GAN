# DC_GAN

Image generation model using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks

# Before running

You need to go to http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html and download the aligned dataset.
After which you need to make a new folder called "celeba" in your working directory and extract the zipped folder there

The final directory structure should look like:
```
./celeba
    -> img_align_celeba
        -> 188242.jpg
        -> 173822.jpg
        -> 284702.jpg
        -> 537394.jpg
           ...
```
